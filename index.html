                <p>Interaction Design is an interdisciplinary field merging design skills such as user experience, interface development and graphic design with programming to create meaningful experiences between the user, digital and physical platforms, such as websites, wearables and mobile devices.</p>

                <p>Modified by the psychological, social, economic and cultural factors that shape our present and future world, this ever-evolving field envisions new ways of human-computer interaction within systems, services, products and spaces across multiple industries.</p>
                        
                <p>Throughout the Interaction Design program, students will be expected to address such topics as mixed realities, immersive environments, usability, spatial relations and human factors. An emphasis on usability testing, research, collaboration and real-world projects distinguish this program.</p>
                        
                <p>This program is part of our School of Design.</p>

        <h3>Skills and Strengths as an IDD Student</h3>

            <article>
                <p>As an Interaction Design and Development student at George Brown, students will learn to collaborate in a team environment with various stakeholders to design multi-disciplinary products and services.</p>

                <p>Students will also have the ability to apply the appropriate tools that allow for designing, building, visualizing, and programming digital interactive experiences. The students in this program will be able to access all Adobe applications to help them learn and create projects. They will learn the basic structures of using <strong> Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, JavaScript, Live Studio Code, Maya,</strong> and many other applications that will help them succeed with their studies. Students will know how to design a complex media project (<em>interface, navigation, graphics, text treatment</em>) using best practice design and development principles, and applying conceptual and theoretical frameworks.</p>

                <p>Students in this program <em>will perform all work in compliance with regulations, legislations, security policies, industry standards and code of ethic</em>. This will be  helpful for students to become more familiar with the standards when finding a career within this field.</p>

                <p>IDD students will also <em>apply creative and innovative thinking techniques to manage change and solve design problems</em>, they'll make recommendations based on human computer interaction design guidelines to improve user experiences with interaction design, and create and design an interactive product or services that will deliver a usable interactive experience.</p> 
                    
                <p>The Interaction Design and Development program at George Brown offers their students with many opportunities to have them succeed in the future. The School of Design helps their students by surrounding them with mentors who are in the design field to guide them with what students should prepare for once they graduate.</p>
